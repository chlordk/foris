# Foris

Foris is Remote Uci - it is a web GUI for configuration of system via Nuci,
i.e. using Netconf.

Nowadays, Foris is in early stage of development and almost everything in it
is a possible subject to change, thus there's no guaranteed API stability
and all the parts should be used externally only with extreme caution, if ever...

## Development
The tools needed for developing can be installed on Debian with the command:
```
  sudo apt install ruby-compass compass-breakpoint-plugin slimit
```
